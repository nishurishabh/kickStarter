# kickStarter 2.0
A react app inspired by the idea of KickStarter and tries to solve trust related issues by using ethereum platform. 

You can run my project by : 
1. Clone to your local machine
2. 'npm install' to install all the npm modules used in the project.
3. 'npm run dev' to run the project.


Hey all, I recently created a react app which tries to solve some problems associated with the KickStarter frauds. The app is build on ethereum platform and the decentralization aspects solve the problems.

I would like to give some highlights of the app :

1. The home page contains all the campaigns that is present on the app. Now the campaigns can be viewed, contributed, and requested by anyone. And no contracts can be deleted anywhere down the line in future.

2. New campaigns can be added by anyone. The person needs to mention the minimum contribution in order to become a approver.

3. Now an approver is the one who can and will vote for the requests associated with the campaign he/she has contributed. This solves the  fradulent transfers of money in the KickStarter.

4. Everyone can view the requests associated with each campaigns and also make new requests.

5. At last, the person who has created the campaign has the power of finalizing a request associated with a campaign. But he can only finalize once the majority of approvers have voted yes for the requests. As the approvers are the one who knows better about the real requests and fradulent requests, they have the decision making power. Once, the request is finalized, money is transferred to the true recipient.
