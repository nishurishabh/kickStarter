# kickStarter 2.0
A react app inspired by the idea of KickStarter and tries to solve trust related issues by using ethereum platform. 

You can run my project by : 
1. Clone to your local machine
2. 'npm install' to install all the npm modules used in the project.
3. 'npm run dev' to run the project.


Hey all, I recently created a react app which tries to solve some problems associated with the KickStarter frauds. The app is build on ethereum platform and the decentralization aspects solve the problems.

I would like to give some highlights of the app :

1. The home page contains all the campaigns that is present on the app. Now the campaigns can be viewed, contributed. And no contracts can be deleted anywhere down the line in future. New Campaigns can be added by anyone mentioning the minimum contribution.

2. Each campaign can be viewed. The approvers, pending requests, address of manager and the campaign balance related to the campaigns. 
Also, anyone can contribute to the campaigns (greater than the min Contribution) to become a approver.

3. Now an approver is the one who can and will vote for the requests associated with the campaign he/she has contributed. This solves the  fradulent transfers of money in the KickStarter.

4. Now the campaign owner can create new spending request mentioning the vendor's address and value to be transferred in Ethers.

5. At last, an approver can go view all the pending requests. He can either choose to approve. Only the manager has the power to finalize the request. Once the request is finalized, the amount is transfered to the particular vendor.
